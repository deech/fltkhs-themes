* fltkhs-themes
`fltkhs-themes` tries to make it easy to write nice consistent-looking
[[FLTKHS][http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fltkhs-0.5.4.5/docs/Graphics-UI-FLTK-LowLevel-FLTKHS.html]]
applications by providing drop-in light themed replacement widgets to the
standard ones with minimal performance and memory overhead.

Please see the [[Hackage
docs][https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fltkhs-themes/docs/Graphics-UI-FLTK-Theme-Light.html]]
for much more information on installation and getting started with this package.

* Screenshots
There is a small but growing [showcase
app](https://github.com/deech/fltkhs-themes-demo) with screenshots that gives a
better idea of look-and-feel.
